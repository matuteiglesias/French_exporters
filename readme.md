# French Exporters Data Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of French exporters, leveraging a series of Jupyter notebooks to explore various aspects of trade data. The project aims to provide insights into economic linkages, growth rates, firm dynamics, and sourcing strategies within the French export market.

## Structure
The repository is organized into several key directories:

- **/data**: Contains all CSV and data files used in the analysis.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks categorized by themes and stages of data analysis.
- **/scripts**: Python scripts used across different notebooks for repeated tasks.
- **/output**: (Optional) Generated outputs from the notebooks, such as graphs and models.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed descriptions of its contents.

## Notebooks Overview
The notebooks are organized into thematic categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data analysis pipeline:

1. **Data Extraction and Preparation**: Notebooks related to initial data extraction and setup.
2. **Economic Network Analysis**: Exploring economic networks through buyer-seller relationships.
3. **Growth and Trade Analysis**: Examining the growth rates and trade patterns of French exporters.
4. **Firm Dynamics and Market Analysis**: Analyzing the dynamics and market strategies of firms.
5. **Advanced Data Analysis and Modeling**: In-depth statistical models and data analysis techniques.
6. **Visualization and Geographic Analysis**: Geographical data representations and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To run the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to install the required Python packages. A `requirements.txt` file is provided for convenience.
