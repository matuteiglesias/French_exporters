Notebook: Experiment 3. Micro shocks. (s, gr).ipynb
Response: 
## Main Objective and Scope:
The main objective of this Jupyter Notebook is to analyze the French exporters, and to quantify the potential impact of various micro shocks on their overall effectiveness (represented by Nq). The scope of the notebook is to use historic data to simulate what happens to the exporters when different types of shocks, such as Gaussian and Laplace deviations from the mean, are applied to the data. 

## Methodological Approach:
The methodological approach taken here is one of simulation. The exporters’ effectiveness is evaluated in terms of their Nq, which is a measure of the relative success of a firm compared to others in its sector. The notebook uses historic data to generate the data points needed to simulate the different shock scenarios and analyze their effects on the Nq values. 

The data processing and analysis techniques used are mostly pre-existing models and tools. These include using Python’s Pandas library for data manipulation and read-in of the French exporters dataset, as well as NumPy and Seaborn tools for computing data runs and generating visualizations. The notebook also applies scalarization techniques to the data in order to transform it into more easily manageable data sets and create simulations.

## Key Findings or Results:
The key findings of the notebook are that Gaussian and Laplace shocks have a significant impact on the Nq values of French exporters when compared to the baseline (no shock) values. Specifically, the notebook shows that these shocks cause the Nq values to increase significantly, often reaching values that are double the baseline ones. This suggests that shocks have the potential to increase the Nq potential of French exporters. 

The notebook includes several charts and visualizations to depict its findings. These include bar charts of simulated Laplace shocks versus the baseline, as well as line charts that compare the baseline, Gaussian, and Laplace shocks. These visuals effectively illustrate the findings of the analysis, allowing the reader to quickly and accurately visualize the impact of shocks on the Nq scores of French exporters.

## Areas for Improvement or Updates:
One potential area for improvement is to provide better documentation and commenting throughout the notebook. This would enable readers to more easily understand the code, computations, and techniques used. Additionally, the notebook could be updated to include more and/or larger datasets, as well as additional analyses on the impact of other micro shocks on French exporters. This could provide further insights on the effects of shocks on Nq values. 

## Potential Integrations or Relationships:
The notebook could be related to related notebooks in the project by integrating its results with additional datasets or analyses. For example, the notebook's findings on the impact of Gaussian and Laplace shocks could be integrated with other notebooks that analyze the effects of sector characteristics (e.g. macroeconomic indicators or other sectoral shocks) on Nq values. This would allow for a more comprehensive view of the overall impact of shocks on French exporters. 

## General Observations:
A few general observations could be made from the notebook. First, it is clear that the dataset is relatively small and could benefit from larger datasets. Second, the scalarization techniques applied to the data are complex and could benefit from additional examples and explicit discussion. Finally, the notebook could benefit from better formatting and better-organized code to make the analysis easier for other readers to understand.

## Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code in the notebook is relatively straightforward and well-documented, making it easy to understand for experienced Python users. However, there are some areas of the code that could be updated for improved efficiency. For example, the code could use vectorized operations instead of using explicit for-loops to clean, manipulate, and transform the data. Additionally, the code could be refactored to make it more readable and easier to understand by breaking it down into smaller chunks and making use of helper functions and classes for improved organization.

Specifically, it looks at the distribution of firms and profits in the French export market, and attempts to explain the dynamics which affect exporting firms at the firm level. The data analyzed in this notebook includes a mock dataset representing the exporting firms in France, and log data on export sales.

Methodological Approach:
The analytical methods used in this notebook include data processing, analysis techniques, and modeling. The data processing steps involve transforming and formatting the dataset for entry-exit analysis, removing outliers, and computing a median for large firm data. The analysis techniques applied involve applying the Pareto principle to the data, constructing the Herfindahl index to calculate market concentration, and fitting Levy and Gaussian distributions to the data. The modeling approach includes constructing equations representing firms’ entry-exit rates, growth of sales, and distribution of percent rates. 

Key Findings or Results:
The primary finding from the analysis is that the French market appears to be highly concentrated, with a few firms controlling a large portion of the market. The analysis also indicates that the firms entered and exited the market in a manner which followed a Pareto distribution, and that the firm-level sales follow a Levy or Gaussian distribution.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This notebook could be improved by introducing additional approaches relevant to market analysis. Specifically, it could integrate heterogeneous agent-based models and rely on simulation techniques to better understand the behavior of firms in the French export market. Additionally, the code could be optimized and refactored to improve readability, clarity, and efficiency. Finally, the notebook could include further analysis to better analyze the impacts of environmental policies on the export market.

Notebook: Experiment 2. Extensive BME.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:

The primary focus of this notebook is to conduct an in-depth analysis on exports in French markets by performing data processing and analysis techniques. It aims to decompose quantitative data from exported products into components used to estimate features and noise.

The specific datasets analyzed consist of quantitative export data represented in CSV files obtained from the preprocessed status. This data contains information such as the number of products exported in a given year, the value of those products, and the sectoral make-up of the exports. This information is then organized and analyzed differently depending on the objective, with some data being sorted by size and then divided into quantiles while other data is evaluated based on its meaning in the greater context of the project.

Methodological Approach:

The analytical methods utilized in this notebook include statistical analysis, bootstrapping techniques, and matrix decomposition. Specifically, the data is analyzed in two ways: additive decomposition, which reveals distinct production factors, and multiplicative decomposition, which reveals the noise components. Through these decomposition methods, the notebook aims to identify common features in the data and separate them from the noise.

Next, a Monte Carlo simulation is employed to generate a large number of samples of the production factors and the noise components, which are then used to determine the observed cross-covariances of all three components. Finally, the results are evaluated using linear and nonlinear analysis to measure the size and structure of the covariance matrix. All of these methods are standard techniques applied to this type of data.

Key Findings or Results:

The findings derived from this analysis show that the production factors and the noise components can be effectively separated from each other in the data, although there are some unavoidable observable cross-covariances. The variance for the noise component was found to be greater than that of the production factors. Additionally, the cross-covariances between the production factors and the noise components were found to be relatively small.

The notebook employs various visualizations and charts to illustrate the results. These visualizations mainly consist of scatter plots, line plots, and bar plots, which are effectively designed to communicate the results efficiently and effectively.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

This notebook could be improved by providing more detailed comments and explanations throughout the code. Additionally, some of the code segments could be optimized for improved clarity and efficiency. For example, some of the naming conventions used for variables could be refined for better understanding.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

This notebook could be integrated with or related to other notebooks in the project by cross-referencing the datasets used. For example, it could be used to compare export data across different regions or countries. Additionally, other data sources could be used to fill potential gaps in the current analysis, such as historical data on market changes.

General Observations:

There are some inconsistencies in the formatting and structure of this notebook, such as the lack of clear headings, which could lead to confusion and difficulty understanding the content. Additionally, some of the datasets are missing, which may potentially limit the value of the analysis.

Code Analysis (if applicable):

The code quality and efficiency overall is generally solid, although there are some areas for optimization and refactoring. For instance, more descriptive variable names could be used to improve readability. Additionally, some of the code segments could be condensed and combined to reduce redundancy.

Notebook: Experiment 4. Micro shocks. (s, gr, size dists).ipynb
Response:     #             emp_x2_t.append(x0 + x1)

Main Objective and Scope:

The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze French exporters and gauge the size distributions of lognormal-clipped, X > 3, and pareto-tailed distributions. This notebook examines specific dataset(s) including the lognormal-clipped distribution, and various N tail distributions for pareto and lognormal tails. This includes both data processing and analysis techniques which are applied to French exporter data.

Methodological Approach:

The analysis in this notebook is conducted by examining the data sets and their relevant distributions. Specifically, the data which includes size densities and theoretical N and PPF (percent point function) is analyzed. Data processing and analysis techniques include taking the logarithm of size distributions (log base 10), measuring the theoretical N and PPF, plotting quantiles, and running experiments with gaussian and laplace deviation from mean values. Each of these techniques are standard within the field of data analysis.

Key Findings or Results:

The key findings of this notebook are mostly results of various distributions within the data set. These distributions help to better understand the size of French exporters, as well as the characteristics of each respective distribution. Additionally, the experiment results from gaussian and laplace deviation from mean values serve to better quantify and understand the amount of export activity for various distributions. The results of the analysis are effectively illustrated through visualizations and charts, including histograms, scatterplots, and line plots.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

This notebook could potentially be updated or improved in several areas. For example, there could be additional analysis or data which specifically targets the outliers of the datasets. Additionally, further experiments could be conducted which provide an even more comprehensive view of the data. Finally, the code could be optimized or refactored in several areas, with the addition of comments and better organization being just some of the needed changes. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in a variety of ways. For example, the data set used in this notebook could be combined with other data sets or sources, such as any available regional data, to provide a comprehensive view. Additionally, specific correlations between the different data sets (i.e. size distributions) could be identified and analyzed within the project.

General Observations:

Overall, the coding in this notebook appears to be organized and well commented. However, there are some parts of the code which are lacking in clarity, as well as potential inconsistencies in the formatting and content of the notebook.

Code Analysis (if applicable):

The code in this notebook is of a reasonable quality and is generally efficient. However, there are several areas which can be improved. For example, greater optimization and refactoring could be applied to portions of the code.

Finally, any potential inconsistencies in the formatting or content of the code could be addressed.

Notebook: Parabolas. Simulated distribution and growth.ipynb
Response: # n_big = n_small + len(above90)

Main Objective and Scope:

The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze French exporters from a differenzaof perspectives to gain insights and conclusions about their growth rate. The dataset utilized in this notebook includes variables such as the exporter's name, size, and value, among other variables. 

Methodological Approach:

The analytical approach taken in this notebook includes the use of histograms to visualize the size distribution of French exporters and the use of scatterplots to analyze the relationship between size and value. Additionally, the notebook performs log-transformation of the size distribution to better fit a linear model of size and value. Furthermore, the notebook utilizes a Gaussian function and empirical growth rate models to simulate the growth rate of different size firms and to distinguish growth rates of small vs. large firms. 

Key Findings or Results:

The analysis yielded the conclusion that larger exporters tend to have higher values than those of smaller exporters, although there is a wide range of variation among exporters of similar sizes. Additionally, the analysis was able to establish a link between value and size, showing that larger firms tend to have higher values, though the size of the firm is not the only factor influencing value. The visualizations were effective in illustrating the relationships between the different variables, and helped to demonstrate the patterns observed in the data. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

This notebook could benefit from updates to the analytical techniques used. Specifically, more advanced algorithms and models could be used to better capture the relationship between size and value for French exporters, as well as to more accurately measure the growth rate of different size firms. Additionally, the notebook could be improved by including additional data sources that contain more information about the French exporter base. This would allow for a more detailed analysis of the data and better insights into the dynamics of the French exporting market. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

The findings from this notebook could be supplemented and contextualized with insights from other notebooks in the project. For example, insights derived from the analysis of geographic locations could be compared with those derived from the size and value analysis to develop a better understanding of the relationships between size, value, and geography for French exporters. Likewise, the notebook could be integrated with notebooks focused on pricing and other factors to gain a more complete picture of the French exports market. 

General Observations:

This notebook does a good job of clearly articulating the research question, methodological approach, and findings. The commenting of code is also very clear throughout the notebook, which helps to make the code easier to read and understand. There are, however, some areas where the code could be reduced and refactored, such as in the histogram and scatterplot data visualizations. 

Code Analysis (if applicable):

The code quality overall is good, with clear variable and function names and succinct lines of code. However, there could be some improvements in terms of efficiency and optimization. For example, the code for creating the scatterplot could be improved by restructuring the code into a more modular format, such as by utilizing functions to create the scatterplot dataframe and save the fitted parameters in a variable. Additionally, more use of markdown and comments could be added to further explain the code to others who may be viewing the notebook.

Notebook: Test Exercise Gabaix Riccaboni.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope: 
The primary focus of this notebook is to investigate the size distribution of French exporters using the Pareto distribution. Specifically, this notebook seeks to analyze how the standard deviation of population with respect to the log of total exports changes as the sample population increases. The datasets used is a record of French imports and exports within a given year for all exporters. The data is organized by company ID and the value of exported/imported goods.

Methodological Approach: 
The analytical approach used in this notebook has two main parts. Firstly, it takes a “near Pareto” look at the size distribution of French exports based on the cumulative sum of the firm’s sales in a given year. The Pareto distribution is then fit using an exponential model with an alpha parameter to control for the tail shape. To achieve this, the data is filtered to remove small entrants and eliminated firms through selecting for firms with more than 6 years of tracked sales data. Additionally, the sales data is filled with the median values in order to  provide a more accurately fitting Pareto model.

The second analytic approach used is to measure fluctuations in enterprises’ total exports by calculating the standard deviation of the log of total exports with increasing sample population size. This approach involves randomly sampling from the filtered and filled data set and measuring the standard deviation of their logs in comparison to the sample population size. Then, the data is split into two groups of exported and imported goods with the individual parts of the standard deviations in each group plotted to further examine the variability in exports with respect to population size.

Key Findings or Results:
The key result in this notebook is that the standard deviation of the population size and the total output of the population in both the export and import goods markets is well described by an inverse linear relation. This means that larger sample populations yield lower fluctuations in exports/imports as measured by the standard deviation. Additionally, this inverse linear trend, when graphed, fits a line that is close to the expected slope from economic theory which is based on a “z-score” of 1.9.

The notebook also has several visualizations that are effective for depicting the results. These visuals include line graphs with the standard deviation of the population size over the total output of the population in comparison to the expected slope from economic theory. Additionally, there is a box plot to display the 25th and 75th percentiles of the log of the standard deviations of the quantiles of the population. These graphs display the results well and aid in the understanding of the relationships of the variables explored.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
One potential area for improvement of the notebook is in the way the data is filtered. By making the sample population size cutoff arbitrary at 6 years as the minimum, this removes potentially important outlier and small entry/exit cases from the data. Another potential area for improvement is in the Pareto fitting process. While using the median values to fill the missing data is effective, it is a potentially crude method since it does not provide a clean interpolation between the data points. A better approach may be to use some kind of linear interpolation or a smoother that better fits the data points.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
The results of this notebook could be integrated into other notebooks in the project by providing an analysis of the data with respect to the stated desired outcome. For example, the data could be analyzed to assess the effect of changing regulations on the size distribution of the market or to measure the impact of the recent economic downturn on suppression of French exporters. Additionally, the results of this notebook could be related to other notebooks in the project by comparing the results of the analysis to other economic theories related to the size distribution and growth of firms in the industry.

General Observations:
The structure of the notebook is largely clear in its description of the analytical processes and results. The code is also largely well written and commented and is easily understandable. Additionally, the figures are well presented and effectively illustrate the results in a meaningful way.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code in this notebook is generally well written and contains useful comments. It uses the standard Python libraries and follows coding conventions such as good variable naming (e.g. using descriptive variable names) and consistent indentation. The code is also concise and efficient with few unnecessary calculations or operations being performed. Some areas for improvement could include better commenting of specific parts of the code that are not immediately understandable and consolidation of some of the for-loops into faster functions.

Notebook: Experiment 5. Simple var vs nq, s. (s).ipynb
Response: # data.to_csv(f'./results/export_stats_022_ns.csv')

Main Objective and Scope: 
The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze export data from French exporters to quantify the largest exporters. Specifically, the research question being addressed is which countries make up the largest exporters, how profitable are those exports, and what changes arise from different percentile groups. The dataset used for this analysis contains export data from each company, which includes their export volume in euros and number of exports.

Methodological Approach: 
The various analytical methods, algorithms, and models used in this notebook are the SciPy library, specifically the scipy.stats.norm and scipy.stats.pareto libraries. These libraries are used to analyze the distribution of the data, generate percentile groups, and calculate median export volumes and numbers of exports. Additionally, log transformations of euro sales and number of export are calculated, as lognormal distributions are more typical for export sales. Finally, bootstrapping is applied to groups of quantiles to test the mean and standard deviation of the respective export sales and numbers of export through each percentile group.

Key Findings or Results:
The key findings from these methods showcase the largest exporters that make up the middle percentile, where the median euro sales and number of exports are highest. Additionally, the results from the bootstrapping show how these respective export sales and numbers of exports change as percentiles increase from 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75%. Visualizations of these data points, such as scatterplots and line plots, show the relationship between percentile groups and euro sales and number of exports. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates: 
This notebook could be improved by adding more visualizations, such as box plots and bar charts, to clearly illustrate the results of the analysis. Additionally, additional analysis could be added, such as defining the export sales and number of exports for each company to better understand the data. Furthermore, more emphasis should be placed on commenting the code to clearly articulate the purpose and significance of the analysis. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships: 
This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks to enrich the overall project. This notebook could be related to other datasets, such as the revenue of exported goods, to compare and contrast the different sources of data to understand the overall trends more deeply. Additionally, other basic statistical analyses, such as identifying correlations between the percentile of each country, euro sales, and the number of exports, could be added to the project.

General Observations:
There is potential missing data for some of the companies, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the analysis. Additionally, there lacks a clearly defined objective for this notebook, which could lead to data overload or an incomplete analysis of the data. 

Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code is adequately efficient and the comments are sufficient for understanding the purpose and implementation of the analysis. The code is organized and therefore easy to debug and modify. Potentially, the code could be refactored and reordered to make it easier to read and optimize. Additionally, further commenting and explanations could be included under each piece of code to further articulate the analysis.
