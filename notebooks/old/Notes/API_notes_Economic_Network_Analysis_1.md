1. **Code Breakdown and Functionality:**
   - The first code cell imports the necessary modules, including IPython.display, numpy, and dd.read_csv. This allows the notebook to display data using HTML, to access basic numerical operations, and to read data from the specified file.
   - The second cell sets the path for the dataset.
   - The third cell calls the display function from IPython.display, along with a style function to set the table width.
   - The fourth cell uses the dd.read_csv function to read the 2014 csv data in the drive_path.
   - The fifth cell performs a groupby operation on the original dataset, computing the mean value of VART_sum grouped by ID and YEAR.
   - The sixth cell initializes the window variable to 3, which will be used in a later section for a rolling calculation.
   - The seventh cell initializes an empty list for assortativity results.
   - The eighth cell performs a groupby operation on the data_sec dataframe, applying two aggregate functions to the data: tunique for 'CN ID 8' and sum for 'VART_sum'.
   - The ninth cell adds the ID_degree values to the ID_degree_res list.
   - The tenth cell reads in the ID_deg dataset from pd.read_csv.
   - The eleventh cell merges several datasets using .merge and .reset_index to create the assortativity_info dataframe.
   - The twelfth cell adds the assortativity_info results to the assortativity_res list.
   - The thirteenth cell creates a bin column in the ID_degree dataframe, using pd.cut to group numerical values from the ID_degree['ID_degree'] column into bins of size 0.5.
   - The fourteenth cell runs the ID_deg computation and saves the results to the ID_deg_save.csv file.
   - The fifteenth cell merges three dataframes and runs the computation using .compute().
   - The sixteenth cell saves the degree values to the degree_values.csv file.
   - The seventeenth cell calls .apply() and .sample() to get the ID values from the data_sec_sample dataframe.
   - The eighteenth cell plots the average number of ID and VATs in the ID_nunique_bin.
   - The nineteenth cell initializes the size_df_list with an empty list.
   - The twentieth cell creates size_i_df_list with a groupby() and agg() function calls.
   - The twenty-first cell concatenates size_i_df_list into size_df_list for all size bins.

2. **Data Handling and Processing:**
   - The notebook employs pandas and dask for data handling and processing. The dd.read_csv() and groupby() functions are used to read and manipulate the dataset, while numpy’s log10() function is used for data transformations.
   - The methods employed are efficient and scalable, as demonstrated by the use of the .compute() command whenever a computation needs to be run.

3. **Analytical Techniques and Modeling:**
   - The analytical techniques and modeling are mostly focused on the use of descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis. This is demonstrated by the groupby() and agg() functions used to create summaries of the data, as well as the pd.cut() function used to generate bins for the degree data.

4. **Visualization and Results Presentation:**
   - The results presentation is mostly done by the groupby() and agg() functions used to create summaries of the data. Additionally, a plot is created to visualize the average numbers of ID and VATs in the ID_nunique_bin. Furthermore, the data is saved to csv files to allow further analysis. 
   - Suggestions for improving the visualizations may include adding labels to axes, using different colors and shapes in the plot to differentiate points, and adding a legend.

5. **Refactoring and Modularization:**
   - The code can be refactored and modularized by extracting the data processing steps into separate functions. For example, the computing of the ID_degree and degree_values can be extracted into separate functions, as well as the plotting of the ID_nunique_bin. Additionally, the code blocks that perform file input/output operations can be grouped into a single function.

6. **Integration with Other Notebooks:**

### Code Breakdown and Functionality
This code cell begins by importing the buyer and seller degrees and relevant link information. This data is being imported from an external source, likely as a CSV file, using the Pandas library. Following this, the code executes a groupby operation on the imported data frame, using the ‘bin’ variable to split the data into various bins for further analysis. The dataset is then aggregated into median and mean ID and VAT degrees using the Pandas aggregate function.

### Data Handling and Processing
The Pandas library is being used for all data handling and processing throughout this notebook. It provides the necessary features for importing external data sources, aggregating and grouping data, and performing various calculations and transformations. The code in this cell is specifically using the groupby() and agg() functions to compute median and mean values over the aggregated data. 

### Analytical Techniques and Modeling
In this code cell, the code is implementing basic descriptive statistics and data aggregation techniques, to compute median and mean values for the ID and VAT degrees. No specific analytical techniques or modeling is done here. 

### Visualization and Results Presentation
The code in this cell is not generating any visualizations or results, so there is nothing to assess for this section. 

### Refactoring and Modularization
This code cell could potentially be refactored by creating a function that encapsulates all of the code into a single, understandable operation. This would make the code more modular and easier to reuse and understand later on in the project. 

### Integration with Other Notebooks
This code cell could be potentially integrated with other notebooks in the project by extracting the code into a shared function, which can then be called from other notebooks for standardized operations. This would not only streamline the overall structure of the project, but also create more reusable code and reduce duplication. 

### Gap Analysis and Further Exploration
There are no gaps in the analysis done in this code cell, as it is performing basic operations. No further exploration is needed.

**Code Breakdown and Functionality:**

The code cell imports libraries including pandas, numpy, os, and matplotlib.pyplot, and selects two files using the pandas library and the ``open()`` command in the ``os`` library. The cells then reads each of the selected files into two dataframes using the pandas ``read_csv()`` function, which enables the notebook to analyze contained data.

The dataframes are then assigned to variables ``buyers`` and ``sellers`` and visualized in the dataset. The illustrated files are compressed in the owed column in the ``buyers.describe()`` which results in a numerical summary of the dataset. It is also print out in series in the ''buyers.head()`` and ``sellers.head()`` functions. 

The main function of this cell is to import two separate files and present them in dataframes for analysis.

**Data Handling and Processing:** 

The methods used for data handling and processing are primarily based on the Python libraries pandas, numpy and os. The pandas library allows for data to be read into dataframes and enables manipulation of the data. The ``open()`` command enables two separate files to be read using the pandas ``read_csv()`` function and compressed into dataframes. The ``describe()`` command is then used to create a numerical summary and ``head()`` command for a series-based summary. 

The efficiency and scalability of this method is dependant of the amount of data contained in the files being read. If the files contained significant amounts of data, the processing time may slow due to the amount of time needed to read and compress into a dataframe. There may also be opportunities for optimization when dealing with larger files.

**Analytical Techniques and Modeling:**

This notebook does not utilize any specific analytical techniques or modeling approaches; instead, it serves as a platform for which further analysis and modeling can be conducted on the imported dataframes.

**Visualization and Results Presentation:**

The visualization and results presentation in this notebook are limited. The dataframes are visualized in the data set but there are no discernible tables or charts. There may be opportunities for visualization in further analysis.

**Refactoring and Modularization:**

The structure of the notebook is straightforward and concise, making it straightforward to comprehend and follow. However, there may be an opportunity for refactoring and modularization. Extracting basic functions used in the cell, such as ``read_csv()`` and ``describe()``, would help to make the code easier to understand and increase readability.

**Integration with Other Notebooks:**

This notebook can be easily integrated with other notebooks as it only imports files into two dataframes. The ability to share functions or data across the project can help to streamline the project structure.

**Gap Analysis and Further Exploration:**

This notebook does not directly provide any insights or analysis of the data. It is an important cog in creating the foundations for further analysis, as it imports data into dataframes for manipulation. There may be an opportunity to further explore the characteristics of imported datasets.

Notebook: Degree Distribution Visual Exploration.ipynb.ipynb
Response: 
1. **Code Breakdown and Functionality:**
   - The first cell contains two arrays: bins and hist. bins is an array of values ranging from -0.25 to 4.5 in incremements of 0.02 and hist is an empty placeholder for a histogram data set.
   - The second cell contains a matplotlib histogram plotting command, which creates a normalised histogram of the ID_degree values in the df dataframe using the bins array.
   - The third cell contains a similar plot command, this time using the plt.plot() function from the matplotlib library. This creates a scatterplot depicting the mean of each ID_degree as a marker, and the total count of each ID_degree as the y-value. The marker is set to be semi-transparent with no outline, and the legend has been removed.

2. **Data Handling and Processing:**
   - The data is handled and processed using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. Pandas is used to manipulate and extract data from the dataframe, specifically to extract the values in the ID_degree column into a series and to compute the mean and count of each ID_degree value. Matplotlib is used for plotting, and creates both a histogram and a scatterplot of the data.
   - The data processing is relatively straightforward and efficient. All the data is loaded into memory at once and manipulated as needed.  There are no major inefficiencies or opportunities for optimization.

3. **Analytical Techniques and Modeling:**
   - No analytical techniques or modeling are being used in this notebook. This notebook is mainly focused on data presentation and visualization.

4. **Visualization and Results Presentation:**
   - The notebook visualizes the data in two ways. The first is a cumulative and normalised histogram of the ID_degrees, and the second is a scatterplot showing the mean and count of each ID_degree. These visualizations effectively illustrate the distribution of the ID_degrees and enable further insight into the data.
   - Suggested improvements could include a larger marker size for the scatterplot and interactive elements such as panning and zooming.

5. **Refactoring and Modularization:**
   - This notebook can be improved by refactoring and modularizing the code. The function and class definitions can be extracted into separate modules and imported to be used in the main script. This would improve code reusability and readability.

6. **Integration with Other Notebooks:**
   - This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in this project by extracting a common module containing the plotting code and sharing that between notebooks. This would make the code easier to modify and maintain.

7. **Gap Analysis and Further Exploration:**
   - This notebook provides a good visual representation of the ID_degree data, however further exploration could be carried out to gain a more detailed understanding of the data. For example, clustering algorithms could be used to identify different groups within the data and drill down into those for insights.

Notebook: ID Degree Distribution Plotting.ipynb
Response: 
1. **Code Breakdown and Functionality:** The code begins by creating an empty array for bins, with values ranging from -0.25 to 4.5, in steps of 0.02. This array is then used in a for loop, to loop through three values of the variable window. In each iteration of the loop, the range and cumulative/normed values of the histogram data are specified. Values for the 'ID_degree' column for each window are then plotted, in an alpha 0 histogram. This is followed by another for loop, which uses a logarithmic degree distribution plot to plot the mean and count for the ID_degree column. Finally, the legend is removed.  
The overall functionality of this code is to plot the data from the 'ID_degree' column in a histogram and degree distribution plot, in order to visualize the data. The code segments must be executed in sequence, in order for the plot to be generated.

2. **Data Handling and Processing:** For data handling and processing, the code makes use of NumPy library for array operations, and Matplotlib for plotting and visualization. NumPy is used to create the array for bins. Matplotlib is used to plot the data as a histogram, and a degree distribution plot. The data is read from the dataframe and used in the plots. The code is relatively efficient and scalable, as the data is read from a dataframe and plotted.

3. **Analytical Techniques and Modeling:** The code does not involve any analytical techniques or modeling, as it is a plotting exercise.

4. **Visualization and Results Presentation:** The code generates two plots, a histogram and a degree distribution plot. The first plot serves to provide an overview of the data from the 'ID_degree' column, while the second plot shows the mean and count of the same data. Both plots are easily interpretable, with clear label and axes, though the legend in the degree distribution plot could be improved.

5. **Refactoring and Modularization:** The code could be refactored and modularized by moving common code fragments into functions. For example, the plotting code can be moved to a function, while the generation of the bins array and range of values can be moved to another separate function. This would facilitate code reusability and readability.

6. **Integration with Other Notebooks:** This notebook can be integrated with other notebooks in the project by consolidating the code fragments for plotting and extracting the code for the bins array into functions, as suggested in the previous section. These functions can then be called from other notebooks in the project as needed, in order to reduce code duplication.

7. **Gap Analysis and Further Exploration:** The current analysis does not provide any insights on the data, as it is only a plotting exercise. Further exploration could involve performing statistical analysis on the data, or investigating relationships between different parameters in the data.
