Notebook: Firm baskets CN 4-digit.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:
The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the trade data of French exporters. Specifically, it focuses on analyzing the unique buyers associated with a given exporter, their firm size, and their total export value. The data manipulated includes: 1) a dataset containing information on French exporters including their total export value (VFTE), unique buyers (VAT), and firm size; 2) a dataset containing a cross-sectional description of goods and services (NC8); 3) a dataset containing the four-level product classification of the goods and services (CN).

Methodological Approach:
This notebook employs a combination of data processing and data analysis techniques to answer its research question. First, the dataset containing the French exporter data is filtered to display only exporters that have at least one unique buyer and their export value is greater than 0. This dataset is then grouped to obtain the number of unique buyers associated with an exporter and the firm size. Second, a dataframe containing a cross-sectional description of goods and services is created by merging the exporter dataset with the product classification dataset. This dataframe is filtered to display only those exporters with firm size greater than 5. Third, a new dataset is created by summing the total export values by product and year of delivery. Finally, visualizations of the firm size and associated total export values are created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

Key Findings or Results:
The analysis reveals significant insights regarding the toal export values associated with a given firm size and the total value of exports by product. The total export values associated with a given firm size exponentially increase with an increase in the firm size. The exports by product reveal that textiles and computer, electronic equipment are the two highest exports, followed by aircrafts and spacecrafts, electrical items, and pharmaceutical and chemical products. The visualizations of the firm size and total export value also illustrate the exponential increase in total export value with an increase in the firm size. These visualizations are effectively designed and clearly illustrate the key findings.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This notebook could use improvements in several areas. First, additional commenting of the code would help document the workflow and improve overall clarity. Second, the data processing and analysis techniques should be described in greater detail to more clearly illustrate their role in the workflow. Third, several of the imports and variables are never used - these should be removed to reduce clutter. In addition, there are opportunities to incorporate additional data sources to supplement the current analysis. Specifically, incorporating data on price, destination of exports, and the overall export value of the firm could improve the overall analysis.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be related to and integrated with other notebooks in the project in several ways. For example, by merging the exporter data with data on price, the dataset could be used to analyze the effect of price on total export value. Additionally, merging with data on destination of exports could help identify regions or countries with the most export activity.

General Observations:
For the most part, this notebook is well structured and provides important insights into the total export activity of French exporters. The quality of the code appears to be generally good, though areas of improvement were noted in the Areas for Improvement or Updates section.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
Overall, the code quality is good. However, some areas for optimization or refactoring could help improve the code's performance. For example, unnecessary variables, import statements, and loops should be removed. Additionally, data manipulation operations could be combined to reduce redundancy.

### Plot
### Export diversification ##
### Plot


Main Objective and Scope:

The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the determinants of buyer diversification among different export industries in France. To do this, the notebook replicates the regressions and scatterplots presented in the Krammarz 2016 paper, and visualizes the results. The main datasets analyzed are a series of measured firm sizes, buyer diversifications, and export diversifications in different industries. The datasets contain characteristics such as the proportion of production exported, firm size, and the number of buyers selected.

Methodological Approach:

The analytical approach taken in this notebook consists of replicating the regressions and scatterplots outlined in the Krammarz 2016 paper. This includes calculating the median firm size for each export section and graphing the relationships between this size, the proportion of production sold to foreign buyers, the number of buyers selected, and the exported and domestic diversification. All of the data processing, analysis, and graphing in this notebook is done in a standard way, in line with what is recommended in the scholarly article.

Key Findings or Results:

The most significant finding from the analysis in this notebook is that firm size has a strong impact on buyer diversification. Specifically, the higher the firm size, the lower the proportion of production sold to foreign buyers. Additionally, higher firm size means a lower number of buyers selected for sales. This pattern is consistent across both the domestic and export diversification categories, which are plotted side by side. The visualizations used effectively illustrate these findings, with informative details on the data points and axes.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

This notebook could possibly be improved by including a more detailed explanation of some of the methods used. Additionally, more information on the data sources and the time period of the data could be included. The code could also be improved by making use of more efficient data structures and algorithms. Furthermore, additional data and analyses on the complexity of the export structures and the stability of the firms involved could be included to gain more insight.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in the project by including more detailed visualizations or implications of the findings, such as how the firm size impacts the geographic distribution of buyers. Additionally, integration with other notebooks could be accomplished by exploring the interrelationships between this notebook's analysis, other available datasets, and any previously generated insights from other notebooks.

General Observations: 

Overall, this notebook is well structured and the visualizations clearly demonstrate the findings. However, the work may benefit from more detailed explanations of the methods used, as well as relevant background information for the data sources and time frames. There also appears to be some inconsistency in the formatting and title conventions between different code sections, as well as in the capitalization of variables and code labeling.

Code Analysis (if applicable):

This notebook includes code that is generally well formatted and organized. The main areas that could be optimized are the data structures, algorithms, and syntax used. For example, more efficient structures for analyzing and sorting data could be implemented, such as dictionaries, sets, arrays, and dataframes.

Notebook: recovered-blob_020.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:

The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the patterns of French exporters in terms of their degree of connectivity within the export market. The data analyzed includes firm size, sector of activity, and sophistication of the exports. The specific datasets used in this analysis are comprised of datasets containing trade and export data from the French Government. These datasets cover the years 2013 to 2014, and feature trade values and other related statistics on French exporters.

Methodological Approach:

The analytical approach taken in this notebook is an exploratory data analysis applying tools such as pandas, numpy, and dask to process the data and generate insights from it. The notebook begins by importing several Python modules, including IPython and numpy, and loading the necessary datasets. The data is then processed through multiple groupby functions to summarize and aggregate the relevant information. Specifically, the degree of connectivity of firms is measured by taking the average of the log10 of sum of firm-level trade values (VART_sum) across different years for each firm ID (ID), followed by computing the network degree distribution. Subsequently, the notebook assigns every firm to a size bin based on firm size and further divides the firms into their sectors of activity, then measures the degree of each firm in the same sector. Additionally, random sampling is used to sample 50 firms from each size bin and measure the degree of connectivity across these firms. Finally, the notebook also measures accents from the data and plots the assortativity of firm size and connectivity.

Key Findings or Results:

The findings of the analysis indicate that French firms have positive assortativity, meaning that firms tend to connect to others of the same size and sector. As a result, the more connected firms tend to be larger and investors in larger firms benefit from the positive effect due to the accumulation of connections. Further, the analysis reveals that the difference in the degree of connectivity between firms is much larger than expected, and that larger firms are more active in the export market than the smaller ones. This has implications for international trade, as larger firms are more likely to drive economic growth. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

The current notebook could be improved in terms of readability as there are many parts that are quite dense and difficult to grasp. It would be beneficial for readers if the code was broken down into smaller chunks, with more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each operation and potential modifications that can be made. Further, the lack of comments can make it difficult to understand the overall logic of the notebook. In terms of data, it would be interesting to compare sector and firm sizes over multiple years to understand any changes or patterns over time.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

This notebook can be integrated with other notebooks related to the project such as those related to market entry analysis or concentration analysis. In particular, the degree of connectivity of French firms as determined by this notebook could be used to better understand market entry patterns as more connected firms are likely to have a presence in multiple markets. Additionally, the concentration analysis could be used to further explore the significance of degree of connectivity to the firm size and overall market structure.

General Observations:

The notebook could be improved in terms of its overall structure and format. For example, some of the logic of the notebook is not completely clear, such as the steps between binning the firms based on size, sampling 50 firms from each size bin, and measuring the degree of each firm in the same sector. Additionally, there are some typos in the code and inconsistencies in the format used. 

Code Analysis (if applicable):

The code in this notebook is generally well-structured and efficient, making effective use of libraries such as pandas and dask. However, some areas could be further refactored to improve readability. For example, some of the lines of code with long expressions could be divided into shorter segments, and some of the operations could be further consolidated. Additionally, variable and function names should be made more descriptive and explicit to better guide answering higher-level questions.

Notebook: Determinants of diversification_2.ipynb
Response: #### Main Objective and Scope:
The primary objective of this notebook is to generate a series of scatter plots for visualizing the relationship between firm size and export diversification. The scope of this notebook is constrained to analyzing data related to French exporters, specifically the dataset from Krammarz (2016), with focus on the regressions presented in Table 3. The specific dataset utilized is a disaggregated version of the Kramarz (2016) dataset, categorized by broad sectors of exports. 

#### Methodological Approach:
The analytical approach for this notebook includes performing descriptive analyses, using standard Matplotlib and Seaborn functions. These analysis techniques are used to generate a series of scatterplots to visually demonstrate the relationship between firm size and export diversification. 

The process begins with the importation of Python modules, including Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, as well as relevant CSV files containing the necessary data. The datasets are parsed using Pandas library, and any missing data is filled via interpolation. Descriptive statistics of the firms are calculated, in terms of both export and firm size. Then, a basic estimation is performed, transforming the data into panel data format. Finally, the scatterplots are constructed and formatted using standardized Matplotlib and Seaborn functions. 

#### Key Findings or Results:
The scatterplots illustrate the relationship between export section diversification and firm size, based on the regression parameters from Krammarz (2016). In particular, the plotted points indicate that some firm sizes are more likely to diversify into multiple export sections than others. Specifically, firm sizes in the small to medium range (i.e. those with around 10-80 export partners) tend to have more diverse export facilitation compared to very large firms (i.e. those with over 100 export partners).

The visualizations are effective in illustrating the findings, utilizing simply formatted scatterplots. The variations in the color and transparency of the points, based on the export section, are especially useful for conveying the complexities of the relationship. 

#### Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This notebook could be further improved by including additional analyses. Currently, it is limited to basic descriptive and visualization techniques. An interesting addition could include bivariate analysis between the different export categories, to better demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of export diversification. Additionally, incorporating more detailed firm-level data could be useful for explaining variations in export diversification that are not accounted for in the current dataset.

#### Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook has the potential to be integrated with other notebooks within the project. For instance, it could be linked with extras notebooks focused on different elements of the dataset, such as the cost of exporting, labor productivity, or other economic indicators. Furthermore, this notebook could be related to other notebooks that focus on the relationship between firms and export diversification.

#### General Observations:
This notebook is well-documented and relatively straightforward to follow. There are minor inconsistencies in phrases and formatting, such as the inconsistent capitalization of “export partner.” The code is generally well-written and efficient, adhering to standard Python conventions.

#### Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code in this notebook is written in Python and primarily utilizes Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries. It is straightforward and clearly commented, making the code easy to understand and debug. The code also adheres to general standards in the Python coding community, with appropriate indention and naming of variables and functions. In addition, the use of vectorized operations makes the code more efficient. There is potential for optimization in the sections related to data transformation, but overall the code is clean and optimized.

Notebook: in-ex margins.ipynb
Response: # clip(change, -inf, 0).sum().sum()
# plot_outliers()
# Output results

Main Objective and Scope:
The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the growth of French exports and imports in regards to the size of the firms exporting and importing. Additionally, it looks at the unique trajectory of individual firms to understand how their growth over time follows current market trends. The dataset utilized is composed of monthly export and import data from French firms over a certain period of time.

Methodological Approach:
The first step of this notebook involves importing the necessary modules for data analysis. Next, the data is cleaned up and firms with export or import values around one million euros are sampled. Visualizations are used to illustrate the product of this sampling, such as horizontal or vertical plots of the time evolution of the firms within the sample.

The data is then plotted in a ‘phase diagram’ to illustrate the trajectory of individual firms in relation to the market over time. Additionally, a change in the dataset over two time periods (2002-2005) is computed. This change is then used to determine the growth of exports and imports based on the size of the firms. Finally, a plot_outliers() function is used to output the results of the analysis.

Key Findings or Results:
The key findings derived from this analysis are the changes in exports and imports of French firms over a certain period of time, and how these changes are associated with the size of the firms. The visualizations present an effective way of illustrating this analysis, providing insights into the overall trajectory of the firms over time. It is possible to see the individual trajectory of firms in relation to the market based on the ‘phase diagram’ plotted. The outliers plot also provides additional information on larger firms in the data, which can be used to make further conclusions regarding the dataset.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This section of the notebook could use improvement in regards to code quality and efficiency. As it stands, the code is written inefficiently and inefficient sections are not commented with information or clarification.

Additionally, the notebook would benefit from commented code segments which explain the purpose of each computation or visualization.

Notebook: Assortativity_2.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope: 
The primary focus of this notebook is to measure the relationship between buyers and sellers in terms of the number of exported products. It looks at two datasets: the buyer (ID) dataset, which contains information about the number of products exported to buyers across France, and the seller (VAT) dataset, which contains information about the number of products exported from sellers across France. Both datasets contain each entity's degree, which is a measure of how many transactions they are involved in. The goal of this notebook is to understand the degree distributions when looking at buyers and sellers jointly.

Methodological Approach:
The analytical method used in this notebook is aggregation. Specifically, the notebook aggregates the buyer and seller degrees by creating a 'bin' variable to represent the degree ranges. The bin variable is then used to group the buyer and seller degrees into corresponding bins. The aggregation function is then applied to the ID_degree (buyer) and VAT_degree (seller), producing median and mean values respectively. This provides a snapshot of both the buyer and seller degree distributions.

Key Findings or Results:
The aggregated results show that the buyer and seller degree distributions have a similar shape, with both having a concentration in the lower end of the degree range. This suggests that both buyers and sellers are mainly involved in low-level transactions. Other findings include the fact that the seller degree is generally higher than the buyer degree, indicating that there might be a power imbalance between the two. Additionally, median buyer degrees are higher than mean buyer degrees, suggesting that the majority of buyers are of the “long tail” type, who are only involved in a few transactions. 

The results are presented using a bar chart, which is effectively designed and provides a good overview of the data. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This notebook does not provide any commentary on the results or significant insights in the conclusion, so it would be beneficial to add a discussion section that thoroughly evaluates the findings and offers potential explanations for why the buyer and seller degree distributions are similar. Additionally, the code could be more efficient with the use of looping structures. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in the project in order to explore the relationships between other factors and the degree distributions of buyers and sellers. For example, the notebook could be linked to one that analyzes the geographic distribution of buyers and sellers to see if geographic location has an impact on their degree distributions.

General Observations:
The notebook is easy to follow and all code segments have comments, so it is relatively easy to understand. However, more commentary and discussion about the analysis could be included to make the analysis more insightful.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code segments are relatively efficient, making good use of vectorization when possible. No significant refactoring is needed.

Notebook: degree data (legacy).ipynb
Response: Main Objective and Scope:
The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the French exporters dataset in order to identify economic trends and relationships between different data sources. The specific dataset(s) or data types examined include firm sizes, degree values, and exports. The data is structured in the form of CSV files containing financial metrics and trade activity.

Methodological Approach:
The methods used in the notebook to analyze the datasets include numerical calculations (e.g. log10), visualization methods (e.g. line graphs), and statistical analysis (e.g. random sampling). Specifically, the data processing and analysis techniques applied include log10 transformations on the firm size data, grouping and aggregation techniques to analyze the degree information, and selection sampling for the exports data. Furthermore, the notebook uses the IPython "display" library to present visualizations, and the Pandas and Numpy libraries for data manipulation and calculation. The use of these libraries provide for a standard approach to the analysis. 

Key Findings or Results:
The analysis of the datasets allows the notebook to draw significant results, insights, or conclusions regarding the relationships between the different data sources. For example, the analysis is able to identify an assortative pattern in the degree of firms, meaning that firms are more likely to do business with firms of similar size. Moreover, it is able to predict the size categories of firms based on their degree information. Visualizations such as line graphs are used to illustrate these findings, effectively illustrating how the degree and size of firms are related.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
The notebook could be improved to ensure that common best practices are used for code optimization, readability, and efficiency. Specifically, more comments, annotations, and descriptions should be included to better explain the purpose of the code. Furthermore, variable names should be consistent throughout the notebook to improve legibility. Additionally, further statistical analysis should be included to better support and validate the findings. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be integrated with notebooks in the project focused on trade analysis and visualizations. Specifically, the degree data could be combined with trade activity to gain a greater understanding of the trading dynamics between firms. Furthermore, further data sources such as geographical information on tariffs and trade barriers could be used to identify relationships between economic geography and trade.

General Observations:
The notebook is generally clear and well presented, though there are some inconsistencies in formatting when it comes to code comments and spacing. Furthermore, some variables and functions are not clearly named or described. Additionally, there is some missing data due to the lack of historical records on certain firms.

Code Analysis:
The code generally follows conventions such as indentation and naming conventions, though there are a few instances of unconventional usage such as dataset designation (e.g. "dataset_i"). Furthermore, there are some areas for optimization such as the usage of for-loops for calculations rather than vectorization, and the repeating of workflows such as file reading and processing. Additionally, refactoring could be conducted for large functions and statements to make them clearer and more efficient.

Notebook: Data sampling (old).ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:
- The primary focus of this notebook is to read and sample data on French exporters. The dataset being analyzed is the yearly reports from 1997-2014 included in the project, which contain data on the export values of over 400,000 different firms. The goal is to create an end-result based sample that is filtered by firm size and year.

Methodological Approach:
- Standard file reading and data sorting techniques are used in order to process the yearly reports and create a single, filtered sample. A loop is used to iteratively read and process the data in small chunks, then concatenate them into a single result. Data is filtered by firm size using a separate reference dataset, and also by year and import/export status. Data aggregation functions are employed to results based on certain data fields. Specifics of the data processing and aggregation are detailed in the accompanying functions.

Key Findings or Results:
- This notebook creates a filtered sample of French exporter data, with categories for import/export status, firm size, and year. It provides summary values of export values (VART) based on this sample, broken down according to the YMxpb groups (Year/Month/Export per Bin). Illustrations of the sample output include a graph of Unique users versus number of rows for each concentration period, and a chart of the export values by size bin. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
- There are a few areas where this notebook could be improved. The code could be refactored to be more efficient and optimized with better syntax and variable names. Additionally, the data processing section could be restructured in a more intuitive fashion with better comments and logic flow. Lastly, the visualizations could be improved with more detailed and succinct titles, labels, and colors to improve legibility and data exploration. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
- This notebook can be integrated into the overall project by connecting it back to the corresponding notebooks that explore French exports using additional data or analyses. Ideas for further integration include adding country-level analysis to the filtered sample, or expanding the visualizations to include more detailed graphs and charts.

General Observations:
- The data organization, formatting, and clarity of code lacks consistency and could be greatly improved. Documentation commenting, organization, and readability should be improved in order to make the notebook more accessible.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
- The current code segments lack comments, making it difficult to follow the logic flow and understand its purpose. Additionally, variable names are not intuitive or descriptive, making it difficult to follow the code at a glance. There are inefficient chunks of code that could be reworked or refactored into optimized code segments. There are no checks or log statements built into the code to debug errors or help explain what is happening when the code runs.

Notebook: Countries revealed competitiveness.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:

The main objective of this notebook is to investigate the geographical dispersion of exports for French exporters. Specifically, it looks at their variation over time, with respect to the size of the firms and the type of product being exported. This is accomplished by estimating fixed effects for firm-country and firm-product pairs, then performing data processing and analysis techniques to analyze the findings. 

The scope of the notebook covers analysis of French exporter data, including a variety of datasets and data types (out, out_1, sources_count, multisourcing_firms, df, mu_coeffs_finite, ctries_by_comp, mu_coeffs_finite, FE, sample_ids and firm_prod). 

Methodological Approach: 

The analytical approach followed in this notebook is to: first, construct features around a firm-country (FC) or firm-product (FP) pair combination; such as percentage of total exports of a certain product to a certain country. Second, to calculate the fixed effects by demeaning the percentage of total exports by the combination and taking the mean of the product-country combination; with the goal of normalizing the exported values. Third, optimize the fitting of a normal distribution by minimizing the sum of squares between observed values and an approximated normal distribution. Fourth, create charts to illustrate the findings. 

These techniques consist of foundational data manipulation and analysis tools, such as Import modules, Concatenate, GroupBy, Read_csv, Filter and Sum, as well as data analysis approaches such as Data Visualization and Optimization. Specifically, the notebook uses libraries from SciPy and NumPy such as arange, log10, optimize, np, mlab, erf and linspace to optimize the fitting of a normal distribution to the data. Visualizations are produced in Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the results.

Key Findings or Results: 

The main findings of this notebook are the patterns of previous sourcing of French exporters. Specifically, it finds that for all years and sizes of firms, the majority of sourcing is concentrated in the top few countries, representing around 86% of the total volume. In terms of products, it is found that 60% of rows account for 86% of the total volume, when examining only cases with at least two countries from which to draw a comparison. Additionally, the notebook can explore specific relationships between countries and products, with visualizations illustrating their relative importance.

Visualizations are used to demonstrate the results of the analysis. Specifically, background gradients are used to highlight key areas in Matplotlib plotted charts, which are used to illustrate the relationship between firm-product pair export coefficients and the log size of the firm. Additionally, a Plotly visualization is used to visually evaluate the differences between the two coefficient types. All visualizations effectively showcase the relevant information, being both effectively designed and legible. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:

This notebook could be improved by including comments for clarity and adding explanations for non-standard techniques. Additionally, updating outdated methods, such as the SciPy features used to fit the normal distribution, may improve the efficiency of the analysis. Furthermore, explaining the optimization functions, such as optimize.brentq, would provide better understanding of the more advanced techniques employed in this notebook. Finally, adding unit tests or error-catching could also help ensure that the analysis is accurate.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:

This notebook could be integrated and related to other notebooks in the project by exploring additional analyses for existing data in the other notebooks, for example, by plotting French exporter firm-country or firm-product pair distributions to other countries and products featured in different notebooks. Additionally, factors such as the economic context of the time period could be explored, or further analyses related to the relative importance of products by country could be included.

General Observations:

The code in this notebook is well organized, using appropriate variable names and clear logic. Additionally, all code lines are commented, which is helpful for understanding their impact on the analysis. However, some sections have issues with format consistency, as well as lack of comments to explain non-standard techniques. Furthermore, some code segments could be refactored and optimized, such as the Plotly visualization, where several identical code segments are executed.

Code Analysis (if applicable):

The code in this notebook follows fundamental logic and is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Variable and function names are descriptive, and helper functions are used to reduce code duplication. Some code segments could be refactored to reduce repetition and complexity. Additionally, some code segments could be optimized to improve the efficiency, such as in the Plotly visualization. Finally, there

Main Objective and Scope:
The primary focus of this notebook is to identify the characteristics of French exporters that predict their sales. Specifically, the notebook uses data on buyer-seller pairs to investigate how characteristics of these pairs, such as country, sector, product four-digit codes, and buyer countries’ region and population, affect French exporters’ sales. The dataset used is sourced from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) and contains details on financial transactions in Euro from French exporters to trading partners outside of France. The data covers over 1 million trading relationships as well as relevant characteristics of both the buyer and seller.

Methodological Approach:
The notebook begins by importing the relevant data in csv format before some basic data cleaning, such as removing duplicates and sorting the data by the amount of money transferred (value). The data is then grouped into country, sector, and product four-digit codes to produce an “accessibility score”, calculated from the range of potential characteristics of buyers and sellers. These scores are then explored by making summary tables, describing the data, and displaying various graphs and visualizations. In addition, the data is further clustered into buyer-seller pairs to examine the individual characteristics of these pairs, such as buyer-seller country, product, and sector. These clusters of data can then be used to assess the predictability of sales from each buyer-seller pair and visualize any key relationships between the characteristics and sales volume.

Key Findings or Results:
The key findings from this notebook include a description of the largest French exporter countries, sectors, and product codes, and how these have changed in recent years. There is also an exploration of the country-level evaluation scores and their affects on export sales volume. The notebook also presents the results of the clustering process and the resulting relationship between the buyer-seller pairs’ characteristics and sales volumes. Results from this analysis indicate that certain buyer-seller characteristics, such as country, sector, and product codes, are the most predictive of sales, as measured by the accessibility score. The notebook also presents a variety of visualizations and graphs which serve to illustrate the key findings and show any significant trends in the data.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
The notebook could be improved by providing more detailed comments and explanations for the various code blocks and techniques implemented. Additionally, it might be useful to add more visualizations to better illustrate the results of the analysis, such as bar plots or heatmaps. More nuanced analyses of the data could also be beneficial, including analyses of the differences between buyer-seller pairs with different profiles, as well as an examination of how export sales from certain countries, products, or sectors differ from the average.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be integrated into the overall project as a way to further analyze the data and gain a better understanding of the trends in French export sales. Integrating this notebook with others in the project may enable further insights into the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. For example, combining this notebook with one that specifically focuses on identifying French export trends could provide insights into which countries, products, and sectors are the most important drivers of export sales.

General Observations:
The data provided in the notebook is relatively clean and well-structured, making it easy to analyze and manipulate. Additionally, the notebook includes a number of visualizations and graphs that are effective in illustrating the key findings and highlighting any significant trends in the data.

Code Analysis (if applicable):

Notebook: Monthly evolution_2.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:
The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the monthly evolution of French exporters in order to identify potential trends or insights. The dataset used to perform the analysis consists of three columns: ‘EXPORT’, ‘IMPORT’, and ‘TUINIQUE’. The ‘EXPORT’ and ‘IMPORT’ columns contain binary (1/0) values that indicate whether or not the business in question exported or imported goods in a given month. The ‘TUINIQUE’ column contains a unique identifier for each business. 

Methodological Approach:
Dask is used to analyze the data due to its ability to scale and work well in distributed environments. The notebook utilizes two Aggregation functions, ‘tunique’ and ‘first’, that are imported from an external module called ‘functions’. The ‘tunique’ Aggregation follows a pattern of chunking, aggregating, and finalizing the data, while the ‘first’ Aggregation applies the same functions, but also includes an extra step of mapping each unique identifier to the first value for that identifier. Once the data has been processed, it is then displayed using a Pandas DataFrame called ‘monthly_summary.loc’.

Key Findings or Results:
The main findings here show the monthly evolution of French exporters, with the data revealed through the 'monthly_summary.loc' DataFrame. This DataFrame displays two main columns: ‘IMPORT’ and ‘EXPORT’—both with 1/0 values representing whether or not a business imported or exported goods in a given month. It is clear here that French businesses exported more in total in several months than they imported.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
This notebook could be improved by providing more direct tools or visuals for analyzing the trends in French exports. For example, the addition of line graphs, bar charts, or other visualizations would better illustrate the results. Additionally, more comments or descriptions should be added to explain the code and provide additional context. Finally, more data should be integrated from other sources to improve the overall analysis. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in the project by utilizing the ‘monthly_summary.loc’ DataFrame. For example, one could explore the relationship between export and import volumes over time, or see if certain countries are more apt to either export or import goods. Additionally, an integration with additional datasets such as trade volumes, industries, and/or countries would further enhance the analysis.

General Observations:
The notebook is generally well-structured and includes clear code examples that are easy to read. However, it is lacking in documentation and context, making it difficult to fully understand the data and implications of the results. Specifically, the ‘EXPORT’ and ‘IMPORT’ columns should be clearly labeled to denote their meanings more clearly.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code is well-structured and efficient, making use of the Dask library to scale and process data in a distributed environment. Additionally, the ‘tunique’ and ‘first’ aggregations are effectively implemented and provide useful results. There are no particular areas where the code can be improved or optimized.

    - There are some lines of code that are unclear or could be more concisely written, such as importing libraries and manipulating dataframes. Additionally, variable names are sometimes inconsistent or unclear.

Notebook: Population evolution (violin plots).ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope: 
The primary focus of this notebook is to examine the dynamics of firm entry and exit within the French exporters population. Specifically, it focuses on analyzing the role that exports and imports play in dynamics of companies over time. It achieves this by looking at the distribution of firm sizes over time, in terms of both export and import activity. 

The datasets utilized are the aggregated data compiled at the firm, year, and flow levels. These datasets have a single variable - transaction value at the border (VART_sum).

Methodological Approach:
The methodological approach taken in this notebook is to identify the entry and exit dynamics of firms over time, by calculating the ‘age’ of a firm as the years after its first non-zero record. Inversely, this also means calculating the ‘inverse age’ of a firm as the years before its last non-zero record. This is done by taking the data of firms that have either exclusively export or import activities and using the firm_stats dataset to identify which of these firms have been active after the first 3 years of the sample period and before the last 3 years of the sample period. 

From this, the notebook then identifies the distribution of firm sizes for export and import activities over time by using a mean and minimum value. It also examines how this distribution has changed over time by splitting it into 3-year and 5-year block periods. This data can then be visualized using barplots to illustrate the dynamics of firm entries and exits over time. 

Key Findings or Results:
The key findings of this analysis are that there is an increase in firm sizes when looking at exports relative to imports. Specifically, the average size of firms active in exports has increased, while the average size of firms active in imports has decreased over time. This is illustrated in two barplots, one with a 5-year block period and one with a 3-year block period.

The visualizations used to illustrate this data are effective, as they clearly display the differences in firm sizes over time and allow for comparison between exports and imports. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
One area that could be improved is the efficiency of the code. Specifically, the code is not as streamlined as it could be, with the data processing steps being repetitively used. This could be improved by using more functions. Additionally, comments could be added to the code to explain some of the more complex parts of the analysis.

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in the project by incorporating the data from other notebooks for a more comprehensive analysis. Specifically, incorporating data related to firm characteristics and behavior, such as number of transactions and yearly turnover, could enhance the current analysis. Additionally, this notebook could be related to other notebooks that examine exports from a different perspective, such as number of countries exporting to or products exported by each firm.

General Observations:
It is noted that the datasets available are limited in terms of the data provided. Specifically, only the transaction value at the border (VART_sum) is provided which limits the scope of the analysis. More comprehensive datasets, such as firm characteristics and behavior, could provide a more thorough analysis of the dynamics of entry and exit amongst the French exporters population. 

Code Analysis (if applicable):
The code is mostly effective and efficient, with some areas that could be improved or optimized. Specifically, the code could benefit from the use of functions to streamline the data processing. Additionally, certain parts of the code could be refactored to make it easier to follow, as well as add more comments to explain complex parts of the analysis.

Notebook: Deegree distribution.ipynb
Response: #         plt.axvline(x=thresh_best, color = 'k')
       
Main Objective and Scope:
 - The primary focus of this notebook is to analyze the degree distribution of French exporters. It addresses the research question of what the most common degrees of export are for French companies. 
- The dataset analyzed in this notebook consists of a collection of data from French exporters. This dataset includes information about the company's name, degree of export, and other related data points. It is structured in tabular form with columns representing the variables and rows representing the individual exporter entries. 

Methodological Approach:
- The analytical approach used in this notebook is to use descriptive statistics and data visualization to understand the distribution of degrees of export among French exporters. Specifically, the notebook generates degree distribution plots, which display the number of exporters for each degree of export. It also computes various statistics such as the mean and count of degree of export. In addition, the notebook utilizes plotting techniques such as histograms and axvlines to illustrate the results. 

Key Findings or Results:
- The major findings from the analysis in this notebook are that most French exporters have a low degree of export (1-3). While a few have a higher degree (5+), they are very rare compared to the majority with a low degree. This is demonstrated by the degree distribution plots, which show a sharp decrease in the count of exporters for degrees over 3. This pattern is reinforced by the log degree distribution plot, which plots the mean and count of degree of export against each other. The log degree distribution plot also indicates a threshold of around 1.4, which suggests there is a sharp increase in the degree of export for any value over 1.4.

Areas for Improvement or Updates:
- One potential area for improvement in this notebook is to incorporate a machine learning model to analyze the degree distribution of French exporters. This could allow for more detailed insights into the underlying pattern behind the degree distributions. Additionally, the notebook could be improved by adding more comments and documentation which would make it more readable and understandable. Additionally, more detailed visualizations could be added, such as an interactive plot which allows for further exploration of the data. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
- This notebook could be integrated with other notebooks in the project to gain further insights into the French exporters. For example, the degree distribution of exporters could be compared to other metrics such as the amount of exports in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of exporters. Additionally, data from other sources such as economic indicators or geographical data could be used to explore any correlations between the degree distribution of French exporters and the economic conditions or location of those exporters. 

General Observations:
- The notebook appears to be clear and well structured. Additionally, the data visualization techniques used are effective in illustrating the findings. However, the code could be more efficient and well-commented which would make it easier to understand.

Code Analysis (if applicable):
- The code in this notebook is well structured and organized with clear variable and function names. However, there is a lack of comments which could make it difficult for another user to understand the purpose of certain code segments. Additionally, there are some redundant code segments which could be consolidated or refactored in order to make the code more streamlined and efficient.
