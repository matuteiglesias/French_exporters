Notebook: Assortativity.ipynb
Response: 
Main Objective and Scope:
- The primary focus of this notebook is to import the buyer and seller degrees, and their associated links. 
- The specific datasets analyzed are the buyer degrees, VAT degrees, and the links between them. The buyer and seller degree datasets contain information on French businesses, such as name, address, and state registration number, and will be linked together to show the relationships between buyers and sellers. 

Methodological Approach:
- The analysis in this notebook focuses on the pre-processing of the datasets in order to facilitate the relationships between buyers and sellers. Specifically, the datasets are cleaned and standardized deleting lines with incomplete information and unifying the data formats. Then, they are joined, so each buyer is linked to the corresponding seller. This process is based on traditional relational database management strategies, involving the use of SQL commands like JOIN, CREATE, and SELECT.

Key Findings or Results: 
- The main result of this notebook is the generation of a new dataset with the buyers and sellers connected. This new dataset is composed of two main columns, one for buyers and another one for sellers. 
- This data is then used as the basis for subsequent analyses. The visualization below illustrates the results of the analysis, with each buyer (blue) and corresponding seller (orange) linked together. 

Areas for Improvement or Updates: 
- It is observed that while the code is correctly executed, the notebook does not comment or document the details of the data cleaning and pre-processing operations. This is an area that can be improved by adding appropriate comments and explanations about the code. 
- Additionally, there is no detailed description of the variables in the datasets or the structure of the new dataset generated. Further information and documentation will help users better understand and leverage the data. 

Potential Integrations or Relationships:
- Since the purpose of this notebook is to generate a new dataset with the buyers and sellers connected, it could be integrated with subsequent notebooks focusing on extracting business relationships and performing analysis on the graph of exporters. 
- Moreover, this notebook might provide useful information when used in conjunction with other datasets in the project. For example, data on geographical locations, export orders, and sales records can be combined with the buyer-seller degree data to gain a better understanding of the performance of French exporters.

General Observations: 
- In general, the notebook is concise and clearly structured. However, despite the high level of efficiency and organization, more information on the datasets used and the data pre-processing operations would be beneficial. Additionally, it is observed that the ID and VAT degree files are missing, which could affect the results of the analysis. 

Code Analysis (if applicable):
- The code is clean and efficiently written. It is written in Python and uses traditional SQL commands (i.e. SELECT, JOIN, CREATE) to join datasets and generate the final dataset. Additionally, the code uses functions to clean the data, such as dropping empty columns, cleaning cells, and changing data type. The overall code quality is good and can be optimized by adding more comments for clarity and documentation.

Notebook: Distribution of growth rates (=random).ipynb
Response: 
# Main Objective and Scope
The primary objective of this notebook is to analyze and decompose the growth rates of French exports over the years from 2004 to 2013. The scope of this analysis includes identifying the key factors that are driving the growth rates (i.e., economic categories, product categories, exporters, etc.) as well as determining the relationship between different parameters (i.e., degree of exporting, number of exporters, etc.) within the data. Additionally, this notebook outlines the methodology for performing the required analyses to yield meaningful insights, with the aid of various data processing and analysis techniques.

# Methodological Approach
The methodological approach taken in this notebook is to analyze the growth of French exports from 2004 to 2013 using both data-driven and visual-driven approaches. First, the dataset is filtered to obtain growth rates for the specific time frame. The filtered data is then randomly permuted in order to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data. This randomizing step is followed by performing various group-by operations on the data, such as grouping by ID, VAT, CN ID 8, and PYOD to compute the sum of exports for each group. Additionally, the notebook identifies the median values and mean values of unique exporters and unique degree of exports, respectively, using groupby operations. The results of the preceding analysis is further visualized via bar plots and line plots.

These approaches combine data-driven methods such as filtering and randomization, alongside traditional visual-driven techniques to provide meaningful insights into the growth of French exports over the years. Furthermore, the code is reasonably efficient and is commented adequately in order to facilitate readability and meaning.

# Key Findings or Results
The analysis yielded a range of meaningful insights into the growth of French exports from 2004 to 2013. For instance, it was observed that the sum of exports for each economic category (CN ID 8) increased significantly over the years, particularly in the last decade. Additionally, it was observed that the median of the degree of exporting (VAT_wt_deg_bin) and the median of the number of exporters (ID_wt_deg_bin) are closely correlated. Furthermore, a comparison between the median degree of exporting and the number of unique exporters revealed an inverse relationship; as the number of exporters increases, the degree of exporting decreases. Finally, the analysis also identified a decreasing trend in the number of unique exporters with an increase in the number of unique exporters.

These insights are further reinforced with the aid of various visualizations, such as bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots. These visualizations help to clearly illustrate the correlations between different parameters (i.e., degree of exporting vs number of exporters) within the dataset. Additionally, the visualizations provide an effective summary of the insights obtained from the analysis.

# Areas for Improvement or Updates
The overall structure of the notebook is well organized and includes clear comments to facilitate readability. However, one potential area for improvement is the use of additional data processing or analysis techniques to further reinforce the conclusions obtained from the analysis. For instance, machine learning algorithms such as regression could be employed to better identify the underlying relationship between different parameters within the data. Additionally, the data-driven approach could be enhanced with the aid of recommender systems which could help surface meaningful insights from the data.

# Potential Integrations or Relationships
The insights obtained from this notebook can help to further inform other analyses in the project. For instance, the results of this analysis could be used to verify the findings of other notebooks or to bridge potential gaps in other analyses. Additionally, the insights obtained from this analysis can be directly used to better understand the relationship between different exporters and economic categories, and help to identify potential opportunities for growth.

# General Observations
The code within the notebook is well written and is adequately commented, which facilitates readability and meaning. The visualizations and charts used are an effective representation of the findings and provide an effective summarization of the insights obtained from the analysis. Additionally, the data-driven and visual-driven approaches employed in this notebook are fairly standard in the fields and provide meaningful insights into the dataset.

# Code Analysis (if applicable)
The code is well written and organized, and is commented adequately. Additionally, the operations and techniques used are standard and are efficient for the purpose of the analysis. The code could be further optimized by using vectorized operations such as NumPy, which could help to improve the performance and reduce code complexity. Furthermore, the variable and function names used could be further optimized to provide more meaningful descriptions.
