Problem statement: Drying is mentioned both in explanatory notes for agriculture and food manufacturing.

Solution: UN TSG decision for ISIC Rev.4, applicable also for NACE Rev. 2:
 
. NACE Rev. 2 class 01.63 (Post-harvest crop activities) includes drying activities where no manufacturing-type equipment is used, for example sun-drying of fruit and vegetables, air-drying of forage plants etc.
. Division 10 (Manufacture of food products) includes industrial drying activities (dehydration by artificial means), according to the product class: NACE Rev. 2 class 10.31 (Processing and preserving of potatoes) includes industrial dehydrating of potatoes, 10.39 (Other processing and preserving of fruit and vegetables) includes industrial dehydrating of other fruit and vegetables etc.

NACE Rev. 2 class 10.20 excludes:

but 10.11 includes
- rendering of lard and other edible fats of animal origin

Not excluded are fats of animals from marine. 10.41 includes only: 
- extraction of fish and marine mammal oil

Where can we classify fats from marine material?

Solution: If the fats and oils come from fish or marine mammals, whether edible or not, the activity is also in NACE Rev. 2 class 10.41 because there is a CPA 2008 subcategory 10.41.12 ""fats and oils and their fractions, of fish and marine mammals"".

Problem statement: The OJ title reads ""Yarn (other than sewing thread) of artificial staple fibres, not put up for retail sale"".

However, with the redistribution of content from CPA 2002 subcategory 17.10.55 (Sewing thread and yarn of artificial and synthetic filaments and fibres) that in CPA 2008 is split up and distributed over CPA 2008 subcategories 13.10.81, 13.10.82, 13.10.83, 13.10.84 and 13.10.85 the CN code 5511 30 00 that reads ""Yarn of artificial staple fibres, put up for retail sale (excl. sewing thread)"" became a part of CPA 2008 subcategory 13.10.84.

Including goods ""put up for retail sale"" as well as ""not put up for retail sale"" the title is misleading. 

Solution: The title should read ""Yarn (other than sewing thread) of artificial staple fibres"".

Problem statement: Where do we classify the (usually outsourced) cutting up of textile fabrics?

Units receive from the principal on a subcontracting basis textile fabrics fur cutting up, by using automats, such as laser equipment. The aim is to optimise the various parts to be cut and to minimise the scraps. All they do is to cut up the fabrics supplied by the principal and to return the cut up parts to the principal. 

Historically this activity is carried out by the manufacturer of the apparel and this outsourced part of the manufacturing process is a part of the manufacture of wearing apparel in division 14. Within division 14 and group 14.1 it could be any of the classes 14.12 to 14.19, depending on the type of wearing apparel ultimately to be produced from those cut up fabrics, but the subcontractor normally does not have information on the final use of the textile parts.

Solution: As the majority of the clothing covered in classes 14.12 to 14.19 would be in class 14.13 (manufacture of other outerwear) the outsourced cutting up of textile fabrics should subsequently also be classified to class 14.13 and in terms of manufacturing services subcategory 14.13.99.

Calcined dolomite is explicitly excluded from class 08.11 of NACE Rev. 2 and classified in manufacturing, in class 23.52 (Manufacture of lime and plaster). 

A similar treatment should be applied for kaolin, regardless the fact that ""Kaolin and other kaolinic clays, whether or not calcined"" is covered by CN 2507 00 (not making a distinction between ""calcined"" and ""not calcined""), which itself is linked to subcategory 08.12.21 of CPA 2008 (Kaolin and other kaolinic clays).

Solution: Add ‚Äúthis class also includes: manufacture of calcined kaolin

The amendment has been introduced in the On-line version of the CPA 2008 explanatory notes.

Problem statement: To establish the vocabulary and classification for manufacturing solar energy equipment: solar cells, solar modules, solar panels.

Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. 
A) Manufacturing of solar cells (type of semiconductors), used for direct transforming of solar power into electricity, are to be classified in NACE Rev. 2 class 26.11 Manufacture of electronic components;
B) Manufacture of solar modules, being a set of solar cells, would be classified also in NACE Rev. 2 class 26.11;
C) Manufacture of solar collectors, used for direct heating of water via a water exchanger, are to be classified in NACE Rev. 2 class 28.21 Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners.

Problem statement: The OJ title reads ""Combs, hair-slides and the like; hairpins; curling pins; scent sprays and mounts and heads therefore"".

However, the ""Combs, hair-slides and the like"" have in ISIC Rev.4 been deleted in the inclusions of the explanatory notes, for the following reasons:

""Combs, hair slides and the like"" are classified according to the material they are made of, i.e. 22.19 (rubber), 22.29 (plastic) and 25.99 (metal).

Solution: The title should correctly read ""Scent sprays and mounts and heads therefor"".

The adaptation of software by publisher on own account is publishers second activity and should be treated according to general classification rules for multiple activities.

Problem statement: Where in NACE Rev. 2 are ""Ingenieurb√ºros f√ºr bautechnische Gesamtplanung"" (engineering consultants for constructional overall planning)? In CPA 2002 there are sub-categories 74.20.40 (""integrated engineering services for turnkey projects"") and 74.20.60 (""project management services related to construction and civil engineering works"").

Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. The activity is in NACE Rev. 2 class 71.12. For terminology, see CPA 2002.

Decision date: 15.11.2006

Project management

Problem statement: [From US] (39/40) The definitions exclude project management. What is the definition of project management? If a general contractor subcontracts out each of the steps in the project to different subs - their role, beyond oversight and responsibility for the entire project, is essentially project management. Can a better term be found to describe what I think is the intent of this exclusion - to be in the engineering area, it might need to have arrangement of financing, site selection, etc. beyond those things that are just related to the construction.

Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. ‚ÄúProject management activities related to construction‚Äù is classified in ISIC Rev.4 class 7110 and accordingly in NACE Rev. 2 class 71.12.
